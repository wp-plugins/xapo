A WordPress plugin that lets you accept bitcoin tips on your blog posts.

== Description ==

The Xapo WordPress plugin lets you accept bitcoin tips and donations directly from your blog in just two clicks. 

By allowing your visitors to seamlessly send micropayments, you can monetize your blog and create more of what you love. All it takes is a tiny amount to make a huge difference. 

How it works: the users perspective

1. Click on the Xapo tipping button
2. Enter a secure PIN
3. Select an amount of bits to send

== Installation ==

1. Upload `xapo` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Customize the button on "Xapo Button" Settings screen.

By default the tip button will be added at the end of content, but optionally you can disable it and add it to your theme with <?php print_tip_btn(); ?>
